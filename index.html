THE WISDOM AND/OR MADNESS OF CROWDS
by Nicky Case | apr 2018

MY "WHY" FOR MAKING THIS:
+ to build a foundation for further curiosity about networks, group dynamics
+ to practice teaching with problem-solving, a pre-req for skills
+ to instill transcendent sense of "fundamentally people", of Humanity's Brain <3

		<br><br>

		Sir Isaac Newton was pretty sure he was a smart cookie.
		I mean, after inventing calculus and a theory of gravity,
		he should be clever enough to do some financial investing, right?
		Anyway,
		long story short, he lost $4,600,000 (in today's dollars)
		in the nationwide speculation frenzy known as the South Sea Bubble of 1720.

		<br><br>

		As Mr. Newton later said:
		<i>“I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”</i>

		<next>yeah sucks for him &rarr;</next>

		<br>
		Of course, that's not the only time markets, institutions, or entire democracies went haywire &mdash;
		the <i>madness</i> of crowds.
		And yet, just when you lose hope in humanity,
		you see citizens coordinating to rescue each other in hurricanes,
		communities creating solutions to problems,
		people fighting for a better world &mdash;
		the <i>wisdom</i> of crowds!

		<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

		<b>But <i>why</i> do some crowds turn to madness, or wisdom?</b>
		No theory can explain everything,
		but I think a new field of study, <b>network science</b>,
		can guide us! And its core idea is this:
		to understand crowds, we should look not at the <i>individual people</i>, but at...

		<next>...their <i>connections.</i> &rarr;</next>

<!-- Networks -->

<words id="networks_tutorial_start">

	Now, social connections are for more than just making pretty pictures.
	People <i>look to</i> their social connections to understand their world.

	What you just created is called The Majority Illusion<ref id="majority"></ref>,

	<i>Madness.</i>

	<bon id="books"></bon>

	But people don't just passively <i>observe</i> others' ideas and behaviors,

	So now, let's look at something network scientists call...

	<next>“Contagions!” &rarr;</next>


</words>

<!-- Simple Contagions -->

<words id="simple_simple">
	<i>Let's put aside the "threshold" thing for now.</i>
	Below: we have a person <icon red></icon> with some information.
	Some <i>mis</i>information. "Fake news", as the cool kids say.
	And every day, that person spreads the rumor, like a virus, to their friends.
	And they spread it to <i>their</i> friends. And so on.
	<br>
	<b>
	Start the simulation! &darr;
	(p.s: you can't draw <i>while</i> the sim's running)
	</b>
</words>

<words id="simple_simple_2">
	Note: despite the negative name, "contagions" can be good or bad (or neutral or ambiguous). 
	There's strong statistical evidence<ref id="contagion"></ref> that
	smoking, health, happiness, voting patterns, and cooperation levels
	are all "contagious" --
	and even some evidence that suicides<ref id="suicides"></ref> and mass shootings<ref id="shootings"></ref> are, too.
</words>

<words id="simple_simple_end">
	<next wiggle>well that's depressing &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="simple_cascade">
	Indeed it is.
	Anyway, <b>PUZZLE TIME!</b>
	<br>
	Draw a network &amp; run the simulation,
	so that <i>everyone</i> gets infected with the "contagion".
	<br>
	(new rule: you can't cut the <i>thick</i> connections)
</words>

<words id="simple_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>fan-flipping-tastic &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="simple_post_cascade">
	This madness-spreading is called an <b>"information cascade"</b>.
	Mr. Newton fell for such a cascade in 1720.
	The world's financial institutions fell for such a cascade in 2008.<ref id="subprime"></ref>
	<br><br>
	However: <i>this simulation is wrong.</i>
	Most ideas <i>don't</i> spread like viruses.
	For many beliefs and behaviors, you need to be "exposed" to the contagion more than just once
	in order to be "infected".
	So, network scientists have come up with a new, better way to 
	describe how ideas/behaviors spread, and they call it...
	<next wiggle>“<i>Complex</i> Contagions!” &rarr;</next>
</words>

<!-- Complex Contagions -->

<words id="complex_complex">

	Let's bring back "thresholds", and the binge-drinking <icon yellow></icon> example!
	When you played with this the first time, people didn't change their behavior.

	<br><br>

	Now, let's simulate what happens if people <i>do</i> start drinking
	<i>when 50%+ of their friends do!</i> 
	<b>Before you start the sim, ask yourself what you think <i>should</i> happen.</b>

	<br><br>
	
	<b>Now, run the sim, and see what actually happens! &rarr;</b>

</words>

<words id="complex_complex_2">
	<span style="line-height:1.3em">
		
		Unlike our earlier "fake news" <icon red></icon> contagion,
		this contagion <icon yellow></icon> does <i>not</i> spread to everyone!
		The first few people get "infected", because although they're only exposed to one
		binge-drinker, that binge-drinker is 50% of their friends. (yeah, they're lonely)
		In contrast, the person near the end of the chain did <i>not</i> get "infected",
		because while they were exposed to a binge-drinking friend,
		they did not pass the 50%+ threshold.

		<div style="height:0.75em"></div>

		The <i>relative</i> % of "infected" friends matters.
		<i>That's</i> the difference between the <b>complex contagion</b> theory,
		and our naive it-spreads-like-a-virus <b>simple contagion</b> theory.
		(you could say "simple contagions" are just contagions with a "more than 0%" infection threshold)

		<div style="height:0.75em"></div>

		However, contagions aren't necessarily bad &mdash;
		so enough about crowd <i>madness</i>, what about...
		<next>...crowd <i>wisdom?</i></next>

	</span>
</words>

<words id="complex_complex_3">

	Here, we have a person <icon blue></icon> who volunteers to... I don't know,
	rescue people in hurricanes, or tutor underprivileged kids in their local community, or something cool like that.
	Point is, it's a "good" complex contagion.
	This time, though, let's say the threshold is only 25% &mdash;
	people are willing to volunteer, but only if 25% or more of their friends do so, too.
	Hey, goodwill needs a bit of social encouragement.

	<br><br>

	<b>&larr; Get everyone "infected" with the good vibes!</b>

</words>

<words id="complex_complex_3_end">

	<b>NOTE:</b> Volunteering is just <i>one</i> of many complex contagions!
	Others include: voter turnout, lifestyle habits, 
	career choices, challenging your beliefs,
	taking time to understand a issue deeply &mdash; basically, anything
	that needs more than one "exposure", and some social encouragement.

	<br><br>

	(So what's an example of a <i>simple</i> contagion, that only needs one exposure to "infect" someone?
	Usually: bits of trivia, like, "the possum has 13 nipples")

	<br><br>

	Now, to <i>really</i> show the power and weirdness of complex contagions, let's revisit...

	<next>...an earlier puzzle &rarr;</next>

</words>

<words id="complex_cascade">
	Remember this? This time, with a <i>complex</i> contagion <icon blue></icon>, it'll be a bit tougher...

<words id="complex_post_cascade">
	Now, you may think that you just need to keep adding connections to spread any contagion,

<words id="complex_post_cascade_end">

<words id="complex_prevent">
	If you hit "start" below, the complex contagion <icon blue></icon> will just spread to everyone.
	No surprise there.
	But now, let's do the <i>opposite</i> of everything we've done before:
	<b>draw a network to <i>prevent</i> the contagion from spreading to everyone! &darr;</b>
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent_2">
	You see?
	While more connections will always help the spread of <i>simple</i> ideas,
	<b>more connections can hurt the spread of <i>complex</i> ideas!</b>
	(makes you wonder about the internet, hm?)
	And this isn't just a theoretical problem. This can be a matter of life...

<words id="complex_prevent_end">
	<next wiggle>...or death. &rarr;</next>

<words id="complex_groupthink">
		
	The people at NASA were smart cookies.
	I mean, they'd used Newton's theories to get us to the moon.
	Anyway, long story short, in 1986,
	<i>despite warnings from the engineers</i>,
	they launched the <i>Challenger</i>,
	which blew up and killed 7 people.
	The immediate cause: 
	it was too cold that morning.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	The less immediate cause: the managers ignored the engineers' warnings.
	Why? Because of <b>groupthink</b><ref id="groupthink"></ref>.
	When a group is <i>too</i> closely knit, (as they tend to be at the top of institutions)
	they become resistant to complex ideas that challenge their beliefs, or ego.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	So, that's how institutions can fall to crowd madness.
	But how can we "design" for crowd <i>wisdom?</i>
	In short, two words:

<words id="bridging_1">
	As you may have already guessed,

<words id="bb_small_world_1">

	<i>"Unity without uniformity". "Diversity without division". "E Pluribus Unum: out of many, one".</i>
