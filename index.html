THE WISDOM AND/OR MADNESS OF CROWDS
by Nicky Case | apr 2018

MY "WHY" FOR MAKING THIS:
+ to build a foundation for further curiosity about networks, group dynamics
+ to practice teaching with problem-solving, a pre-req for skills
+ to instill transcendent sense of "fundamentally people", of Humanity's Brain <3

		<br><br>

		Sir Isaac Newton was pretty sure he was a smart cookie.
		I mean, after inventing calculus and a theory of gravity,
		he should be clever enough to do some financial investing, right?
		Anyway,
		long story short, he lost $4,600,000 (in today's dollars)
		in the nationwide speculation frenzy known as the South Sea Bubble of 1720.

		<br><br>

		As Mr. Newton later said:
		<i>“I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”</i>

		<next>yeah sucks for him &rarr;</next>

	</span></div>

<words id="intro_2">

		<br>
		Of course, that's not the only time markets, institutions, or entire democracies went crazy:
		the <i>madness</i> of crowds.
		And yet, just when you lose hope in humanity,
		you see citizens rescuing each other in hurricanes,
		communities creating solutions to problems,
		movements of ordinary people fighting for a better world:
		the <i>wisdom</i> of crowds!

		<br><br>

		<b>But <i>why</i> do some crowds turn to madness, or wisdom?</b>
		And how can we, collectively, get more of the latter?
		According to the new field of <b>network science</b>,
		the answer is not in the <i>individual people</i>, but in...

		<next>...their <i>connections.</i> &rarr;</next>

	</span></div>

<!-- Networks -->

<words id="networks_tutorial_start">

<words id="networks_threshold">

	But people don't just have social connections to make pretty pictures.
	People look at their social connections, to understand their social world.
	In this example, people look to their peers to

	say, binge-drinkers. (img)

	However, networks can <i>fool</i> people.
	Just like how you see the earth as flat because you're on it,
	people get wrong ideas about society because they're <i>in</i> it.

	<br><br>

	(BONUS BOX: OTHER CONNECTIONS)

	<br><br>

	For example, a 1991 study(*) showed that 
	“virtually all [college] students reported that their friends drank more than they did.”
	But that seems impossible!
	How can that be?
	Well, you're about to invent the answer yourself, by drawing a network.

	What you just created is called The Majority Illusion(*),
	which also explains why people think their political views are consensus,

	<i>Madness.</i>

	<br><br>

	(BONUS BOX: a response to the books)

	<br><br>

	But ideas/behaviors aren't just passively observed, they actively <i>spread</i>.
	So now, let's look at something network scientists call...

	<next>“Contagions!” &rarr;</next>


</words>

<!-- Simple Contagions -->

<words id="simple_simple">
	Below, we start with one person (img) who has some information.
	Some <i>mis</i>information. "Fake news", as the cool kids say.
	And every day, that person spreads the rumor to their friends.
	And they spread it to <i>their</i> friends. And so on.
	<br>
	<b>Run the simulation, step-by-step &darr;</b>
	(p.s: you can't draw <i>while</i> the sim's running)
</words>

<words id="simple_simple_2">
	Note: despite the negative name, "contagions" can be good or bad.
	There's strong statistical evidence(*) that
	smoking, happiness, obesity, voting patterns, and cooperation levels
	are all "contagious" --
	and even some evidence that suicides(*) and mass shootings(*) are, too.
</words>

<words id="simple_simple_end">
	<next wiggle>well that's depressing &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="simple_cascade">
	Indeed it is.
	Anyway, <b>PUZZLE TIME!</b>
	<br>
	Draw a network &amp; run the simulation,
	so that <i>everyone</i> gets infected with the "contagion".
	(new rule: you can't cut the <i>thick</i> connections)
</words>

<words id="simple_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>fan-flipping-tastic &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="simple_post_cascade">
	This madness-spreading is called an <b>"information cascade"</b>.
	Mr. Newton fell for such a cascade in 1720.
	The world's financial institutions fell for such a cascade in 2008.
	But so what? You already knew ideas spread.
	However, network scientists have found a <i>new</i>, strange kind of contagion.
	They're called...
</words>

<words id="simple_post_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>“<i>Complex</i> Contagions!” &rarr;</next>
</words>

<!-- Complex Contagions -->

<words id="complex_complex">
	<span style="line-height:1.4em">

		Truth may be stranger than fiction, but it doesn't sell as well.

		<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

		<b>Simple contagions</b>, like juicy rumors or hot takes,
		only need one "infected" friend to spread.
		That doesn't mean the contagion <i>will</i> spread,
		just that one exposure <i>can</i> be enough to spread.
		This, by the way, is how <i>biological</i> contagions (like bacteria &amp; viruses) work. 

		<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

		<b>Complex contagions</b> are weirder.
		Some things -- like norms, habits and hard-to-accept ideas --
		need more social encouragement.
		They need not a minimum <i>number</i> of friends to spread,
		but a minimum <i>percentage</i> of friends to spread!(*)

		<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

		<b>On the right, a person needs <i>AT LEAST 25%</i> of their friends to
		adopt a complex fact (img) before they do.
		Try "infecting" them all with <i>wisdom!</i> &rarr;</b>

	</span>
</words>

<words id="complex_complex_2">
	<span style="line-height:1.4em">

		<b>CAUTION:</b>
		just because an idea/behavior is "complex" doesn't mean it's good,
		(e.g. conspiracy theories)
		and just because it's "simple" doesn't mean it's bad!
		(e.g. cute cat videos)

		<div style="height:0.9em"></div>
		
		Think of it this way:
		simple contagions are weeds, complex contagions are trees,
		and a network is an ecosystem.
		Sometimes weeds are good, sometimes trees are bad.
		But if your ecosystem can <i>only</i> support weeds,
		something's very wrong.

		<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

		(BONUS: OTHER KINDS OF CONTAGIONS)

		<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

		So, how <i>do</i> we make sure our social ecosystem is healthy?
		Let's revisit...

		<next wiggle>...the cascade puzzle!</next>

	</span>
</words>

<words id="complex_cascade">
	You did this before, but now, with a <i>complex</i> contagion (img), it'll be tougher...
	<b>Try to "infect" everyone with complex wisdom! &darr;</b>
	(feel free to just hit 'start' and <i>try</i> as many solutions as you want)
</words>

<words id="complex_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>HOT DANG &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="complex_post_cascade">
	Now, you may think: so what, complex contagions () are just simple contagions ()
	that need more connections?
	Not so fast!
	The difference between "complex" and "simple" is a difference in <i>kind</i>, not degree.
	It's apples vs oranges, not apples vs more apples.
	This idea will be clearer if we revisit...
</words>
<words id="complex_post_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>...yet another puzzle! &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent">
	Now, let's do the <i>opposite</i> of everything we've done before.
	If you hit "start" below now, the contagion will just spread to everyone.
	No surprise there.
	But now, here's your challenge:
	<b>draw a network to <i>prevent</i> the contagion from spreading to everyone! &darr;</b>
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent_2">
	And <i>that's</i> the important difference between "simple" and "complex" contagion.
	While more connections always helps spread <i>simple</i> ideas,
	more connections can <i>hurt</i> the spread of <i>complex</i> ideas!
	(makes you wonder 'bout the internet, hm)
	And this isn't just a theoretical problem. This can be a matter of life...
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent_end">
	<next wiggle>...or death. &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="complex_groupthink">
		
	The people at NASA were smart cookies.
	I mean, they'd used Newton's theories to get us to the moon.
	Anyway, long story short, in 1986,
	<i>despite warnings from the engineers</i>,
	they launched the <i>Challenger</i>,
	which blew up and killed 7 people.
	The immediate cause: 
	it was too cold that morning.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	The less immediate cause: the managers ignored the engineers' warnings.
	Why? Because of <b>groupthink</b>(*).
	When a group is <i>too</i> closely knit, (as they tend to be at the top of institutions)
	they become resistant to hard-to-accept information
	that challenges one's beliefs or ego.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	So, that's how to get crowd madness.
	But how can we "design" for crowd <i>wisdom?</i>
	In short, two words:

	<next>Bonding &amp; Bridging &rarr;</next>

</words>

<!-- Bonding & Bridging -->

<words id="bonding_1">
	&larr; Too few connections, and an idea can't spread.
	<br>
	Too many connections, and you get groupthink. &rarr;

<words id="bonding_2">
	<b>
	Find the sweet spot, and draw a group that's <i>just</i> connected enough
	to spread a complex idea! &darr;
	</b>
</words>

<words id="bonding_end">
	This is called <b>bonding social capital</b>(*),
	the strength of the connections <i>within</i> a single group.
	But what about the connections...
	<next wiggle>...<i>between</i> groups?</next>
</words>

<words id="bridging_1">
	As you might have guessed, <b>bridging social capital</b>
	is the strength of the connections <i>between</i> groups.
	This is important, because it helps groups break out of their insular echo chambers!
	<br>
	<b>Try to "infect" everyone with wisdom:</b>
</words>

<words id="bridging_end">
	Like bonding, bridging social capital has a sweet spot.
	(bonus challenge: try drawing a bridge so thick that the complex contagion
	<i>can't</i> pass through it!)
	Now that we know how to "design" connections <i>within</i> and <i>between</i> groups, let's...
	<next wiggle>...do BOTH. &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="bb_1">

	<b style="font-size:2em">FINAL PUZZLE!</b>

	You just drew a very special kind of network!
	Networks with high bonding and bridging
	are profoundly important, and they're called...
	<next wiggle>“Small World Networks” &rarr;</next>

</words>
<words id="bb_small_world_1">

	<i>"Unity without uniformity". "Diversity without division". "E Pluribus Unum: out of many, one".</i>
	<br>
	No matter how it's phrased,
	people -- across times and cultures -- have often arrived at the same piece of wisdom:
	<b>
	a healthy society needs both tight bonds <i>within</i> groups
	and thick bridges <i>between</i> groups.
	</b>

</words>
<words id="bb_small_world_2">
	That is, not this...

<words id="bb_small_world_5">
	
	Network scientists now have a mathematical definition for this ancient wisdom:
	the <b>small world network</b>(*). This optimal mix of bonding+bridging describes how
	our neurons interact(*), gives rise to collective creativity and problem-solving(*),
	and, at one point, has even helped us (barely) avoid full-out nuclear war!(*)
