THE WISDOM AND/OR MADNESS OF CROWDS
by Nicky Case | apr 2018

MY "WHY" FOR MAKING THIS:
+ to build a foundation for further curiosity about networks, group dynamics
+ to practice teaching with problem-solving, a pre-req for skills
+ to instill transcendent sense of "fundamentally people", of Humanity's Brain <3

<!-- Introduction -->

<words id="intro">

	<br><br>

	Sir Isaac Newton was pretty sure he was a
	<br>
	smart cookie. I mean, after inventing calculus and
	<br>
	a theory of gravity, he should be clever enough to do
	<br>
	some financial investing, right? Anyway, long story short, he
	<br>
	lost $4,600,000 (in today's dollars) in the nationwide
	<br>
	speculation frenzy known as the South Sea Bubble of 1720.

	<br><br>

	As Mr. Newton later said: <i>“I can calculate the motion of
	<br>
	heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”</i>

	<next>yeah sucks for him &rarr;</next>

</words>

<words id="intro_2">

	<div style="height:0.5em"></div>

	Of course, that's not the only
	<br>
	time markets, institutions, or entire
	<br>
	democracies went haywire &mdash; the <i>madness</i> of
	<br>
	crowds. And yet, just when you lose hope in humanity,
	<br>
	you see citizens coordinating to rescue each other in
	<br>
	hurricanes, communities creating solutions to problems,
	<br>
	people fighting for a better world &mdash; the <i>wisdom</i> of crowds!

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	<b>But <i>why</i> do some crowds turn to madness, or wisdom?</b> No theory
	<br>
	can explain everything, but I think a new field of study,
	<br>
	<b>network science</b>, can guide us! And its core idea is this: to
	<br>
	understand crowds, we should look not at the <i>individual
	<br>
	people</i>, but at...

	<next>...their <i>connections.</i> &rarr;</next>

</words>

<!-- Networks -->

<words id="networks_tutorial_start">
	<b>Let's draw a network!</b>
	Each connection represents a friendship between two people:
</words>

<words id="networks_tutorial_connect">
	draw to connect
</words>

<words id="networks_tutorial_disconnect">
	scratch to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disconnect

<words id="networks_tutorial_end">

	when you're done doodling and playing around,
	<next wiggle>let's continue &rarr;</next>

</words>

<words id="networks_threshold">

	Now, social connections are for more than just making pretty pictures.
	People <i>look to</i> their social connections to understand their world.
	For example, people look to their peers to
	find out <b>what % of their friends</b> (not counting themselves) are,
	say, binge-drinkers. <icon yellow></icon>

<words id="networks_pre_puzzle">

	However, networks can <i>fool</i> people.
	Just like how the earth seems flat because we're on it,
	people may get wrong ideas about society because they're <i>in</i> it.

	<bon id="connections"></bon>
	<br>

	For example, a 1991 study<ref id="drunk"></ref> showed that 
	“virtually all [college] students reported that their friends drank more than they did.”
	But that seems impossible!
	How can that be?
	Well, you're about to invent the answer yourself, by drawing a network.
	It's time to...

<words id="networks_puzzle">

	<b style="font-size:2em">PUZZLE TIME!</b>
	<br>
	Fool <i>everyone</i> into thinking

<words id="networks_post_puzzle">

	What you just created is called The Majority Illusion<ref id="majority"></ref>,
	which also explains why people think their political views are consensus,
	or why extremism seems more common than it actually is.
	<i>Madness.</i>

	<bon id="books"></bon>

	But people don't just passively <i>observe</i> others' ideas and behaviors,
	they actively <i>copy</i> them.
	So now, let's look at something network scientists call...

	<next>“Contagions!” &rarr;</next>


</words>

<!-- Simple Contagions -->

<words id="simple_simple">
	<i>Let's put aside the "threshold" thing for now.</i>
	Below: we have a person <icon red></icon> with some information.
	Some <i>mis</i>information. "Fake news", as the cool kids say.
	And every day, that person spreads the rumor, like a virus, to their friends.
	And they spread it to <i>their</i> friends. And so on.
	<br>
	<b>
	Start the simulation! &darr;
	(p.s: you can't draw <i>while</i> the sim's running)
	</b>
</words>

<words id="simple_simple_2">
	Note: despite the negative name, "contagions" can be good or bad (or neutral or ambiguous). 
	There's strong statistical evidence<ref id="contagion"></ref> that
	smoking, health, happiness, voting patterns, and cooperation levels
	are all "contagious" --
	and even some evidence that suicides<ref id="suicides"></ref> and mass shootings<ref id="shootings"></ref> are, too.
</words>

<words id="simple_simple_end">
	<next wiggle>well that's depressing &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="simple_cascade">
	Indeed it is.
	Anyway, <b>PUZZLE TIME!</b>
	<br>
	Draw a network &amp; run the simulation,
	so that <i>everyone</i> gets infected with the "contagion".
	<br>
	(new rule: you can't cut the <i>thick</i> connections)
</words>

<words id="simple_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>fan-flipping-tastic &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="simple_post_cascade">
	This madness-spreading is called an <b>"information cascade"</b>.
	Mr. Newton fell for such a cascade in 1720.
	The world's financial institutions fell for such a cascade in 2008.<ref id="subprime"></ref>
	<br><br>
	However: <i>this simulation is wrong.</i>
	Most ideas <i>don't</i> spread like viruses.
	For many beliefs and behaviors, you need to be "exposed" to the contagion more than just once
	in order to be "infected".
	So, network scientists have come up with a new, better way to 
	describe how ideas/behaviors spread, and they call it...
	<next wiggle>“<i>Complex</i> Contagions!” &rarr;</next>
</words>

<!-- Complex Contagions -->

<words id="complex_complex">

	Let's bring back "thresholds", and the binge-drinking <icon yellow></icon> example!
	When you played with this the first time, people didn't change their behavior.

	<br><br>

	Now, let's simulate what happens if people <i>do</i> start drinking
	<i>when 50%+ of their friends do!</i> 
	<b>Before you start the sim, ask yourself what you think <i>should</i> happen.</b>

	<br><br>
	
	<b>Now, run the sim, and see what actually happens! &rarr;</b>

</words>

<words id="complex_complex_2">
	<span style="line-height:1.3em">
		
		Unlike our earlier "fake news" <icon red></icon> contagion,
		this contagion <icon yellow></icon> does <i>not</i> spread to everyone!
		The first few people get "infected", because although they're only exposed to one
		binge-drinker, that binge-drinker is 50% of their friends. (yeah, they're lonely)
		In contrast, the person near the end of the chain did <i>not</i> get "infected",
		because while they were exposed to a binge-drinking friend,
		they did not pass the 50%+ threshold.

		<div style="height:0.75em"></div>

		The <i>relative</i> % of "infected" friends matters.
		<i>That's</i> the difference between the <b>complex contagion</b> theory,
		and our naive it-spreads-like-a-virus <b>simple contagion</b> theory.
		(you could say "simple contagions" are just contagions with a "more than 0%" infection threshold)

		<div style="height:0.75em"></div>

		However, contagions aren't necessarily bad &mdash;
		so enough about crowd <i>madness</i>, what about...
		<next>...crowd <i>wisdom?</i></next>

	</span>
</words>

<words id="complex_complex_3">

	Here, we have a person <icon blue></icon> who volunteers to... I don't know,
	rescue people in hurricanes, or tutor underprivileged kids in their local community, or something cool like that.
	Point is, it's a "good" complex contagion.
	This time, though, let's say the threshold is only 25% &mdash;
	people are willing to volunteer, but only if 25% or more of their friends do so, too.
	Hey, goodwill needs a bit of social encouragement.

	<br><br>

	<b>&larr; Get everyone "infected" with the good vibes!</b>

</words>

<words id="complex_complex_3_end">

	<b>NOTE:</b> Volunteering is just <i>one</i> of many complex contagions!
	Others include: voter turnout, lifestyle habits, 
	career choices, challenging your beliefs,
	taking time to understand a issue deeply &mdash; basically, anything
	that needs more than one "exposure", and some social encouragement.

	<br><br>

	(So what's an example of a <i>simple</i> contagion, that only needs one exposure to "infect" someone?
	Usually: bits of trivia, like, "the possum has 13 nipples")

	<br><br>

	Now, to <i>really</i> show the power and weirdness of complex contagions, let's revisit...

	<next>...an earlier puzzle &rarr;</next>

</words>

<words id="complex_cascade">
	Remember this? This time, with a <i>complex</i> contagion <icon blue></icon>, it'll be a bit tougher...
	<br>
	<b>Try to "infect" everyone with complex wisdom! &darr;</b>

	(feel free to just hit 'start' and <i>try</i> as many solutions as you want)
</words>

<words id="complex_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>HOT DANG &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="complex_post_cascade">
	Now, you may think that you just need to keep adding connections to spread any contagion,
	"complex" or "simple", good or bad, wise or mad.
	But is that really so? Well, let's revisit...
</words>
<words id="complex_post_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>...another earlier puzzle &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent">
	If you hit "start" below, the complex contagion <icon blue></icon> will just spread to everyone.
	No surprise there.
	But now, let's do the <i>opposite</i> of everything we've done before:
	<b>draw a network to <i>prevent</i> the contagion from spreading to everyone! &darr;</b>
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent_2">
	You see?
	While more connections will always help the spread of <i>simple</i> ideas,
	<b>more connections can hurt the spread of <i>complex</i> ideas!</b>
	(makes you wonder about the internet, hm?)
	And this isn't just a theoretical problem. This can be a matter of life...
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent_end">
	<next wiggle>...or death. &rarr;</next>
</words>

<words id="complex_groupthink">
		
	The people at NASA were smart cookies.
	I mean, they'd used Newton's theories to get us to the moon.
	Anyway, long story short, in 1986,
	<i>despite warnings from the engineers</i>,
	they launched the <i>Challenger</i>,
	which blew up and killed 7 people.
	The immediate cause: 
	it was too cold that morning.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	The less immediate cause: the managers ignored the engineers' warnings.
	Why? Because of <b>groupthink</b><ref id="groupthink"></ref>.
	When a group is <i>too</i> closely knit, (as they tend to be at the top of institutions)
	they become resistant to complex ideas that challenge their beliefs, or ego.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	So, that's how institutions can fall to crowd madness.
	But how can we "design" for crowd <i>wisdom?</i>
	In short, two words:

	<next>Bonding &amp; Bridging &rarr;</next>

<!-- Bonding & Bridging -->

<words id="bonding_1">

	But what about the connections...
	<next wiggle>...<i>between</i> groups?</next>
</words>

<words id="bridging_1">
	As you may have already guessed, 
	the number of connections <i>between</i> groups is called
	<b>bridging social capital</b>.

	<b>Build a bridge, to "infect" everyone with complex wisdom:</b>
</words>

<words id="bridging_end">
	Like bonding, there's a sweet spot for bridging, too.<ref id="bridge"></ref>
	(extra challenge: try drawing a bridge so thick that the complex contagion
	<i>can't</i> pass through it!)
	Now that we know how to "design" connections <i>within</i> and <i>between</i> groups, let's...

<words id="bb_small_world_1">

	<i>"Unity without uniformity". "Diversity without division". "E Pluribus Unum: out of many, one".</i>
	<br>
	No matter how it's phrased,
	people across times and cultures often arrive at the same piece of wisdom:
	<b>
	a healthy society needs a sweet spot of bonds <i>within</i> groups

	That is:

	A quick response to James Surowiecki's <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i>
	</h3>

	<div>

	<img src="sdas" width="200" height="300" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	
	First off, I'm not dissing
	<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds">
	this book.</a>
	It's a good book, and Surowiecki was trying to tackle the same question I am:
	<b>“why do some crowds turn to madness, or wisdom?”</b>

	<br><br>

	Surowiecki's answer: crowds make good decisions when everybody is as independent as possible.
	He gives the story of a game at a county fair,
	where the rabble were invited to guess the weight of an ox.
	Surprisingly, the average of all their guesses <i>was better than any one individual guess</i>.
	But, here's the rub: the people have to guess <i>independently</i> of each other.
	If people knew the previous guesses before they put forth their own guess,
	they'd be influenced by those guesses, and all the results would be skewed.

	<br><br>

	But... I don't think "make everyone be as independent as possible" is quite right.
	Even geniuses, who we tend to mischaracterize as the most independent thinkers,
	are actually influenced deeply by others. As Sir Isaac Newton said,
	<i>“If I have seen further, it is by standing on the sholders of Giants.”</i>

	<br><br>

	So, which idea is correct?
	Does wisdom come from thinking for yourself, or thinking with others?
	As is usually the case with these kind of questions, the answer is: "yes".

	<br><br>

	So that's what I'll try to explain in this explorable explanation:
	how to get that sweet spot between independence and interdependence &mdash;
	that is, how to get a wise crowd.

	</div>

</bonus>
<bonus id="connections">

	<h3>
	What other kinds of connections are there?
	</h3>

	<div>

	For the sake of simplicity, all the simulations here only have one kind of connection,
	friendship, and all the friendships are equally strong.
	But there's other kinds of connections that network scientists think about!
	For example:

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sdas" width="150" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Directional connections.</b> Alice is the boss of Bob, but Bob is not the boss of Alice.
	Carol is the parent of Dave, but Dave is not the parent of Carol.
	Therefore, "boss" &amp; "parent" are <i>directional</i> relationships:
	the relationship only goes one way.
	In contrast, "friends" is a <i>bidirectional</i> relationship:
	the relationship goes both ways. (well, hopefully)

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sdas" width="150" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Weighted connections.</b> Elinor and Frankie are "friends", but not that close.
	George and Harry are super-duper Best Friends Forever.
	Even though there's a friendship connection in both cases, the second one is a stronger:
	the connections have different "weights".
	(The "weights" matter when we think about, say, how people influence each other.
	Best Friends will influence each other more than casual acquaintances.)

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sdas" width="150" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	Just remember: all the simulations in this game are wrong. The same way any map is "wrong".
	You see the map on the left? Buildings aren't actually gray featureless blocks!
	Words don't float above the city! However, maps are useful not <i>despite</i> being simplified,
	but <i>because</i> they're simplified. Same goes for simulations, or any scientific theory.
	Of <i>course</i> they're "wrong" &mdash; that's what makes them <i>useful</i>.

	</div>

</bonus>
<bonus id="contagions">

	<h3>
	What other kinds of contagions are there?
	</h3>

	<div>
	
	There's so, so many ways that network scientists can simulate "contagions".
	I'm just picking the simplest one, for educational purposes.
	But, for completeness, here's other ways you could simulate contagions:

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sdas" width="150" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Contagions with Randomness</b>. Instead of "if your friend is infected, you'll get infected",
	you could simulate "if your friend is infected, you'll get infected <i>with an X% chance</i>".

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sdas" width="150" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>People have different contagion thresholds.</b> 
	In this simulation, I'm pretending everyone has the same threshold for binge-drinking (50%) or
	volunteering (25%) or misinformation (0%). That's not true in real life, of course,
	and you could make your simulation reflect that.

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sdas" width="150" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>An ecology of contagions.</b> This is actually cutting-edge research,
	and I'm not entirely sure how one would do this.
	In my simulations, only one contagion is spreading at a time.
	But what if there were <i>multiple</i> contagions, with <i>different</i> thresholds?
	For example, a simple "madness" contagion and a complex "wisdom" contagion.
	If someone's infected with madness, can they still be infected with wisdom?
	Or vice versa?
	Can someone be infected with both?

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sdas" width="150" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Contagions that mutate and evolve.</b>
	Ideas don't pass perfectly from one person to another the way a virus genome does.
	Like a game of Telephone, the message gets mutated with each re-telling.
	Sometimes the mutant will be more contagious than the original!
	And so, over time,
	ideas "evolve" to be more digestible,
	urban legends "evolve" to be more shocking,
	habits and behaviors "evolve" to be more copy-able.

	Or, in Normal Human Words: when there are wide differences (heterogeneous)
	in the # of friends each individual person has (degree),
	and when low-friend people are friends with high-friend people (disassortative).

	“strong statistical evidence that

	well-written, layperson-friendly book,
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.connectedthebook.com/">

	<br><br>

	But how do they know that the friendships actually <i>cause</i> changes in health, happiness, etc, 
	rather than just being "mere" correlation?
	They did two clever things:

	<br><br>
	1) They used the Framingham Heart Study dataset, which tracked thousands of people for <i>generations</i>.
	The data showed that people were becoming friends first, and <i>then</i> becoming more similar.
	It's true that similarities "cause" friendships (birds of a feather flock together),
	but this proves that friendships "cause" similarities, too.

	<br><br>
	And 2) They found pairs of people where Person A named Person B as their friend,
	but Person B did <i>not</i> name Person A as their friend. Awkward.
	In those cases, they found that the "contagion" <i>only</i> flows in one direction.
	This proves that, indeed, changes in health are caused by social influence,
	rather than caused by external variables like, I dunno,
	a new McDonald's opening up in Person A &amp; B's neighborhood.

	<i>the closest the world had ever been to full-scale nuclear war.</i>

	<br><br>

	Yup, JFK really screwed up on that one.

	<br><br>

	But, having learnt some hard lessons from the Bay of Pigs fiasco,
	JFK re-organized his team to avoid groupthink.
	Among many things, he:
	1) actively encouraged people to voice criticism,
	thus lowering the "contagion threshold" for alternate ideas.
	And
	2) he broke his team up into sub-groups before reconvening,
	which gave their group a "small world network"-like design!
	Together, this "group design" allowed for a healthy diversity of opinion,
	but without being too fractured &mdash; a wisdom of crowds.

	<br><br>

	And so, with the same <i>individuals</i> who decided the Bay of Pigs,
	but re-arranged <i>collectively</i> to decide on the Cuban Missile Crisis...
	JFK's team was able to reach a peaceful agreement with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
	The Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, and in return,
	the US would promise not to invade Cuba again.
	(and also agreed, in secret, to remove the US missiles from Turkey)

	<br><br>

	And that's the story of how all of humanity almost died.
	But a small world network saved the day! Sort of.
